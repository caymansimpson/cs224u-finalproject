Strangely enough, among the high points of the Jewish Museum’s exhibition entitled Wild Things: The Art of Maurice Sendak, is a small alcove off the main gallery.
Decked out with soft pillows, a shaggy rug, and a generous assortment of Sendak books, this retreat from the museum’s crowds was inspired by Max’s imaginary bedroom in Where the Wild Things Are, perhaps Sendak’s most famous children’s tale.
Walking through the exhibit’s thematically arranged rooms, exploring the artist’s Eastern European roots, his connections to Brooklyn’s Jewish community, and his links to Germany, land of the Holocaust and of the brothers Grimm, I was increasingly drawn to this simple room where a weary mother could read to her sleepy child.
