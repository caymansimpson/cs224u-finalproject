Nobody ever wrote a dull autobiography.
If one may make such a bull, the very dullness would be interesting.
The autobiographer has two qualifications of supreme importance in all literary work.
He is writing about a topic in which he is keenly interested, and about a topic upon which he is the highest living authority.
It may he reckoned, too, as a special felicity that an autobiography, alone of all books, may be more valuable in proportion to the amount of misrepresentation which it contains.
We do not wonder when a man gives a false character to his neighbour, but it is always curious to see how a man contrives to present a false testimonial to himself.
It is pleasant to he admitted behind the scenes and trace the growth of that singular phantom which is the man's own shadow cast upon the coloured and distorting mists of memory.
Autobiography for these reasons is so generally interesting, that I have frequently thought with the admirable Benvenuto Cellini that it should be considered as a duty by all eminent men; and, indeed, by men not eminent.
As every sensible man is exhorted to make his will, he should also be bound to leave to his descendants some account of his experience of life.
The dullest of us would in spite of themselves say something profoundly interesting, if only by explaining how they came to be so dull--a circumstance which is sometimes in great need of explanation.
On reflection, however, we must admit that autobiography done under compulsion would he in danger of losing the essential charm of spontaneity.
The true autobiography is written by one who feels an irresistible longing for confidential expansion; who is forced by his innate constitution to unbosom himself to the public of the kind of matter generally reserved for our closest intimacy.
