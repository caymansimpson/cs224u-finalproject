In the following letter Patrick R. Cleburne writes to his fellow Confederate commanders concerning the
Confederate Army's current situation and the benefits of adding black soldiers to the ranks, then setting the
slaves free as compensation for their fighting.
Cleburne, an Irish native personally familiar with living in a country oppressed by a foreign power (Great
Britain in this case), makes an impassioned and practical suggestion to his superior, Joseph E. Johnston.
Would history have turned out differently if Jefferson Davis had followed this path?

Commanding General,
The Corps, Division, Brigade, and Regimental Commanders of the Army of Tennessee
General:
Moved by the exigency in which our country is now placed we take the liberty of laying before you,
unofficially, our views on the present state of affairs. The subject is so grave, and our views so new, we feel it
a duty both to you and the cause that before going further we should submit them for your judgment and
receive your suggestions in regard to them. We therefore respectfully ask you to give us an expression of your
views in the premises. We have now been fighting for nearly three years, have spilled much of our best blood,
and lost, consumed, or thrown to the flames an amount of property equal in value to the specie currency of
the world. Through some lack in our system the fruits of our struggles and sacrifices have invariably slipped
away from us and left us nothing but long lists of dead and mangled. Instead of standing defiantly on the
borders of our territory or harassing those of the enemy, we are hemmed in to-day into less than two-thirds of
it, and still the enemy menacingly confronts us at every point with superior forces. Our soldiers can see no
end to this state of affairs except in our own exhaustion; hence, instead of rising to the occasion, they are
sinking into a fatal apathy, growing weary of hardships and slaughters which promise no results. In this
state of things it is easy to understand why there is a growing belief that some black catastrophe is not far
ahead of us, and that unless some extraordinary change is soon made in our condition we must overtake
it. The consequences of this condition are showing themselves more plainly every day; restlessness of morals
spreading everywhere, manifesting itself in the army in a growing disregard for private rights; desertion
spreading to a class of soldiers it never dared to tamper with before; military commissions sinking in the
estimation of the soldier; our supplies failing; our firesides in ruins. If this state continues much longer we
must be subjugated. Every man should endeavor to understand the meaning of subjugation before it is too
late. We can give but a faint idea when we say it means the loss of all we now hold most sacred â€” slaves and
all other personal property, lands, homesteads, liberty, justice, safety, pride, manhood. It means that the
history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy; that our youth will be trained by Northern school
teachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by all the
influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors, our maimed veterans as fit objects
for derision. It means the crushing of Southern manhood, the hatred of our former slaves, who will, on a spy
system, be our secret police. The conqueror's policy is to divide the conquered into factions and stir up
animosity among them, and in training an army of negroes the North no doubt holds this thought in
perspective. We can see three great causes operating to destroy us: First, the inferiority of our armies to
those of the enemy in point of numbers; second, the poverty of our single source of supply in comparison
with his several sources; third, the fact that slavery, from being one of our chief sources of strength at the
commencement of the war, has now become, in a military point of view, one of our chief sources of
weakness.
The enemy already opposes us at every point with superior numbers, and is endeavoring to make the
preponderance irresistible. President Davis, in his recent message, says the enemy "has recently ordered a
large conscription and made a subsequent call for volunteers, to be followed, if ineffectual by a still further
draft." In addition, the President of the United States announces that "he has already in training an army of
100,000 negroes as good as any troops," and every fresh raid he makes and new slice of territory he wrests
from us will add to this force. Every soldier in our army already knows and feels our numerical inferiority to
the enemy. Want of men in the field has prevented him from reaping the fruits of his victories, and has
prevented him from having the furlough he expected after the last reorganization, and when he turns from
the wasting armies in the field to look at the source of supply, he finds nothing in the prospect to encourage
him. Our single source of supply is that portion of our white men fit for duty and not now in the ranks. The
enemy has three sources of supply: First, his own motley population; secondly, our slaves; and thirdly,
Europeans whose hearts are fired into a crusade against us by fictitious pictures of the atrocities of slavery,
and who meet no hindrance from their Governments in such enterprise, because these Governments are
equally antagonistic to the institution. In touching the third cause, the fact that slavery has become a military
weakness, we may rouse prejudice and passion, but the time has come when it would be madness not to look
at our danger from every point of view, and to probe it to the bottom. Apart from the assistance that home
and foreign prejudice against slavery has given to the North, slavery is a source of great strength to the
enemy in a purely military point of view, by supplying him with an army from our granaries; but it is our
most vulnerable point, a continued embarrassment, and in some respects an insidious weakness. Wherever
slavery is once seriously disturbed, whether by the actual presence or the approach of the enemy, or even by
a cavalry raid, the whites can no longer with safety to their property openly sympathize with our cause. The
fear of their slaves is continually haunting them, and from silence and apprehension many of these soon learn
to wish the war stopped on any terms. The next stage is to take the oath to save property, and they become
dead to us, if not open enemies. To prevent raids we are forced to scatter our forces, and are not free to
move and strike like the enemy; his vulnerable points are carefully selected and fortified depots. Ours are
found in every point where there is a slave to set free. All along the lines slavery is comparatively valueless
to us for labor, but of great and increasing worth to the enemy for information. It is an omnipresent spy
system, pointing out our valuable men to the enemy, revealing our positions, purposes, and resources, and yet
acting so safely and secretly that there is no means to guard against it. Even in the heart of our country,
where our hold upon this secret espionage is firmest, it waits but the opening fire of the enemy's battle line to
wake it, like a torpid serpent, into venomous activity.
