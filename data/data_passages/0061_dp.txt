“I don’t want to brush my teeth!” Sarah screamed.
“Why not?” asked her mom.
“Because there are bugs in my toothpaste,” Sarah answered.
Every night, Sarah tried to get out of brushing her teeth. She made up different stories to explain why she did not want to do it. One time she said that toothpaste made her skin turn green. Another time she said that it was made of snot. Sarah’s mom had heard too many excuses before. She did not think there were bugs in the toothpaste.
So Sarah’s mom said, “Bugs? Where? I don’t see any bugs.”
“You can’t see them, silly” said Sarah. “They are too small to see.”
“Then how do you know they are there?” asked Sarah’s mom.
“Because my teacher said so,” said Sarah. “My teacher called them di-a-toms!” The word made her laugh.
“Oh! I have heard of those” said Sarah’s mom. “But diatoms are not bugs. They are a little bit like animals and a little bit like plants. One scientist named Chris Bowler says we can call them 'plantimals.'”
“Plantimals! That’s funny. Am I a plantimal?” asked Sarah.
“Well, can you make food out of sunlight?” asked Sarah’s mom.
“No,” Sarah said.
“Then you are not a plantimal. Like plants, plantimals can make food out of sunlight.”
“If I can eat plants and animals, then can I eat plantimals?” asked Sarah.
“Yes, you can,” said Sarah’s mom. “But you should not eat toothpaste. You just need to rub the toothpaste against your dirty teeth. The diatoms in the toothpaste will get the bad stuff off. Then you spit out the toothpaste and the bad stuff comes out with it.”
Sarah thought about the plantimals in her toothpaste. They would fight to keep her mouth clean. They were like Superman. They were strong and helpful. Sarah liked Superman, and she liked being strong and helpful.
Sarah smiled and said, “Mom, I want to brush my teeth now! Please pass the toothpaste.”
