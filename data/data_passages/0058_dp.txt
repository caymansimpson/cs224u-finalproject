When our teacher, Mrs. Dursten, announced that the sixth grade was going to put on a musical, I did not think it was a good idea. I thought that because our class did not have many talented singers or dancers, other students would probably just laugh at us. I was so sure that we would be embarrassed that I decided to participate by building props instead of being up on the stage. I am happy to say, though, that I have been proven wrong. The recent musical, "Singing Summer," was a great show, filled with outstanding performances that the whole school enjoyed.
Watching my classmates perform "Singing Summer" was like watching a repertory company perform a Broadway musical. Amy Bennett, Chris Watson, and Leila Toms sang their solos with passion and excitement. Amy, especially, hit all the right notes and had perfect pitch. Her voice was beautiful! And although I expected the vocal quality of the musical to drop when the rest of our class began to sing, everyone’s voices blended together so well that the quality actual improved. Although I have known my classmates for years, I had no idea that so many of them had such excellent voices.
While my ears enjoyed my classmates voices, my eyes were amazed by the dancing skills I saw on stage. From an impressive kick-line to a near perfect rendition of the waltz, the sixth grade dancers could not go wrong. The performers’ energy was so infectious that I wanted to jump on stage with them and start to dance! 
The surprising success of "Singing Summer" is a result of the wonderful talent and energy that our class brought to the stage. I hope we put on another musical this year. It would bring even more joy to our school, and I would definitely not pass up the chance to perform on stage this time!
