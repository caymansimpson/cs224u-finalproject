Dear Editor,
I have just learned that our town’s public art museum will eliminate Saturday
hours next month due to a protracted budget shortfall. Although the continued
shortfall necessitates some cuts in town programs or services, Saturday museum
hours are simply too important to lose.
It will be a severe hardship and loss to our town’s citizens if the museum closes
on Saturdays. For many working people like myself, Saturday is the only day of
the week we have to take advantage of the breathtaking and thought-provoking
artwork our museum has to offer.
Parents often use this day to take their children to the museum in order to
expose them to this important bit of culture.
The public museum has been a boon to this town since it opened in 1975. It has
fostered an interest in the arts, increased cultural awareness, and had a positive
impact on the local economy. Even people from many nearby towns choose
Saturday—a day free from obligation—to come and see artwork here.
This is no frivolous matter; efforts made in this direction would be well spent.
The increase of—for all intents and purposes—a nearly inconsequential amount
to the homeowner tax bill would suffice to keep the museum open. Isn’t our
museum worth it?
I beseech everyone who values our museum to contact his or her town
representative and ask for funding to keep the Saturday museum hours intact.
Sincerely,
Maria B. Williams
