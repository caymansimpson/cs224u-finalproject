For every era, one city is the center of the world. I do not mean literally of course. As the world is not flat, there can be no literal midpoint of the world (excepting the Earth’s core!). But as historians, we have divided the world’s past into eras, and in each era, it seems one group of people dominated the world, and those groups each had an anchor to their power. Rome was the center of the world for centuries, after first surpassing Athens as the most important political, cultural, and social hub of the world. During the 1700s, Paris was the place to be. Later, in the height of the British Empire in the 1800s, London was the center of most of the world. New York City was probably the social center of the world during the so-called “American Century” that followed.
All of this, of course, overlooks the myriad and various movements and peoples that existed throughout the world at any one time. But, then again, it would be impossible to accurately describe the entirety of the world for any single second, let alone multiple millennia. As historians, we have a job to teach children and adults about the important parts of the past so that they can better understand the present. And as historians, we may need to simplify things to make the past easier to understand. Thus, just as we refer to historic periods as the Renaissance or the Victorian Eras, so we center those eras in Florence and London, respectively, to make the subject of history less abstruse and arcane and more simplistic and graspable.
