Across the street from a sandwich shop and a fried chicken joint, a greenmarket sprouts up
every Wednesday in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx in New York City. The market is a
welcome sight in an area that does not have many options for people to buy fresh fruit and
vegetables.
“The lettuce is not as fresh at the grocery store; that’s why I come here,” said Jennifer Gillette
as she paid for four heads of lettuce. Gillette is a vegetarian who lives in the neighborhood.
Mott Haven, a neighborhood in the South Bronx, is located in one of the poorest areas in the
country. In other New York City neighborhoods greenmarkets are more common, but in the
South Bronx there are not many places to buy healthy, organic food.
The summer of 2012 was the first time that the Youthmarket set up shop in this section of the
Bronx, on 3rd Ave. between E. 148th and E. 149th Streets. The Youthmarket is part of a larger
organization called GrowNYC, which helps make neighborhoods better by setting up farmers
markets, community gardens, and recycling in the city.
Since opening in July 2012, the market has attracted a lot of attention from local residents
who live in the area. Many people are excited that there is now a fresh produce market
nearby.
