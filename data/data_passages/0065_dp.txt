The announcement that Donna had reached middle age came
stealthily and without warning.
Donna, at 42 years old, was in perfect health. She was fit, trim, and ate only the
healthiest of foods, eschewing soda and candy. She was still asked for her
identification when buying wine at the grocery store. She ran several miles every
day; in local road races, she was known for beating people half her age.
“Forty is the new twenty!” her friends would say of Donna’s seeming
agelessness.
Donna heard the quip so often that a part of her believed that this aging thing
was surely only for other people.
That all changed during what should have been a fairly innocuous event: a trip
to the Department of Motor Vehicles to renew her driver’s license.
“Name?” the clerk asked, without looking up. Donna replied.
“Address?”
Donna gave it to her.
“Look through there, please,” The clerk gestured toward an eye-testing machine
perched at the edge of the desk. “Read the first four lines,” she sighed.
Donna pushed her head against the contraption.
“Go ahead.”
Donna was perplexed. Everything was fuzzy. “I think the glass is dirty,” Donna
said, searching the desk for a tissue to wipe off the lens.
“It’s not dirty,” the clerk said, her voice dripping with condescension.
“There must be some problem,” Donna said, pressing her head against the
machine once more.
“Ma’am, do you wear glasses?”
“No, no, I don’t,” Donna responded, a little embarrassed now, as other people in
the room began turning to see what was going on.
The clerk glanced down at Donna’s old license and back up at her. “Welcome to
middle age, sweetheart. Come back when you’ve had an eye exam and gotten
glasses.”
