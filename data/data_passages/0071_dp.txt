Soon after Navi got engaged to Roberto, she began learning about
his seemingly magical origins.
She had heard many stories of Roberto’s birth city of Guanajuato, and they had
all captivated her. She was spellbound by the many exotic tales he told her
about the region. At one time, this colonial city was the source of two-thirds of the
world’s silver.
“Our family goes to a beautiful church in Guanajuato,” Roberto had told her while
they courted in the United States. “It is said that silver dust was mixed into the
cement building blocks and that is why the church sparkles.”
Navi had been enthralled. Roberto always told such wonderful stories. She could
not wait to see the city and meet all of Roberto’s family. Navi was excited and
knew that the trip was sure to be inspirational.
While Roberto had imparted to Navi all the wonders of his beautiful city, it had
not occurred to him to mention any dangers. They were young. They were in
love. They lived only in the moment.
Navi was speechless when she saw the Oratorio de San Felipe. “It really does
sparkle!” she exclaimed.
Navi kissed Roberto on the cheek. “I’ll meet you outside,” she said, leaving the
church.
She pulled her sketchpad and pencils from her bag and went to sit against one of
the glorious palm trees outside the church. She began sketching the colossal
cupola, which extended mightily, three stories above the nave.
Suddenly, a sharp pain took hold of her left shoulder. It felt like an electrical
shock. The pain began to pervade the rest of her body.
She had been stung by a scorpion!
The last thing Navi remembered was Roberto kneeling by her side. She woke up
a week later with him holding her hand and telling her a story. “In Mexico,
scorpions are ubiquitous. There are more scorpion deaths here than in any
other place in the world. And they love palm trees,” he said, rubbing her hand
with tears of relief in his eyes. “I should have mentioned that before.”
