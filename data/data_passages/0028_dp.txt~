One way or another, all the events you can recall have an order to them. Or maybe it’s more
accurate to say: You can give order to your own history any way you like. You can think of the
different grades you’ve been in at school. We all understand there’s a difference between
middle school and high school, and between kindergarten and first grade. Each of these years
of school was different in both easy and hard‐to‐notice ways. It may be difficult to remember
the difference between kindergarten and first grade, but you likely remember which grade you
started having different teachers for different subjects.  
School grades are one way of organizing history. In this case, time has been organized for you
by teachers, so that a plan for education unfolds at the right pace. Someone had a certain
progression in mind for you, and so every year your experiences at school changed in different
ways.  
But every person experiences each year differently. Maybe 3rd and 4th grade seem like a blur,
but you can think of ways life was very different living in one town and then moving to live in
another. Places you’ve lived are another way of organizing history. First, you were here; then
you were there; now you’re here.
Drawings you made, trophies you won, notes you passed with friends—all of these come from
different parts of your history, and you can think about them based on how your history is
organized.  
“Oh, yeah. That’s my Youth League soccer trophy. I was goalie on the Mustangs with Dana that
summer. That was in Hoboken, from before we moved to Teaneck.”  
“I was pretty good at watercolors, for a second grader! We had Ms. Stephanie. I thought she
was scary at first, but she told me I could be an artist one day if I paid attention to the way my
colors mixed together.”   
Organizing history allows us to put memories in context, to understand more about something
we remember, see, or find based on when in our history it happened. The ways we organize our
own history are subjective and may change shape over time. But they allow usto step back from
the moment‐to‐momentstream of thingsthat happen to us and understand how we have come
to change, gradually, from a greater perspective.  
That’s exactly what scientists are looking for when they develop ways of measuring natural
history: a way to group many single elementstogetherso that they tell a biggerstory on a longer
scale of time. And just as we might use grades in school on one occasion, and towns we live in
on others, the geologic time scale works well for measuring natural history in some cases, but
in others there may be better alternatives.
That being said, analyzing rock strata is one of the best opportunities out there for using a great
historical organization scheme, for one simple reason—you can see it. The whole concept is
based around the idea you can slice a rock in half—or, better yet, visit a massive exposed rock
formation, like the ones at Monument Valley—and clearly see the different parts of your
historical time scale. And they’re color‐coded—by nature!  
The geologic time scale has got to be one of the simplest, most ingenious applications of
chronography—the measurement of time—to natural science. All the ideas it’s based on are
amazingly,smack‐yourself‐in‐the‐head obviousto ustoday, and yet they have huge implications
for the way we’re able to tell how old something in the natural landscape really is—including
living organisms, dinosaurs and whole continents.
