It is not possible to imagine A Streetcar Named Desire without the influence of Marlon Brando,
the actor who rose to fame playing Stanley Kowalski. On the page, the part is fairly simplistic. Stanley is a
monster and a beast without any redeeming qualities. But Brando and the play’s original director, Elia
Kazan, imagined the character as having a soft underbelly, rooted in his own sorrow, insecurities, and
soulful complexity. Brando’s Stanley is a brute, yes, but he is a brute who hates the fact that he is so
awful. He is also unable to control himself and his passions, and this lack of control is equally
embarrassing to him, even as it is also threatening to Blanche and alluring to her sister Stella.
For instance, after he hits Stella, he comes back to her, famously begging for forgiveness by
shouting “Stella” outside their apartment. But in Brando’s depiction on the stage and later on the screen,
he is soaked from the rain and looks completely desperate, as though he needs Stella to live. He looks
and seems totally helpless and weak, the exact opposite of the brute he appears later when he forces
himself onto Blanche.
The play is excellent and memorable, even when read. But it is Brando’s interpretation of the
male lead role that makes the play indelible. Without Brando, the play would still have a deep meaning,
but with Brando’s interpretation, the play becomes even more profound.
