During the spring, my leaves are light green. My branches are full. Little buds begin to open. I am a good place for a bird to build a nest. Animals wake up and stir inside of me. My roots drink up the water from the refreshing rains.
In the summer, my leaves are dark green. Children climb up to my top. They shake my branches. I give them sticks that they pretend are swords. The days are long. I feel the sun shining on me for hours. Sometimes afternoon thunderstorms cool me off.
When fall comes, the air gets cooler. My leaves are yellow. They fall to the ground. "Crunch, crunch, crunch," they say. The people rake up my leaves. I see the animals too. They gather food to store within me for the long winter ahead.
The cold wind blows. I shiver. Winter is here. My branches are bare. My leaves are gone. The days are shorter. Animals sleep in my trunk to stay warm. I sleep too. I wait for the snow to melt. I wait to see the first sign of spring.
