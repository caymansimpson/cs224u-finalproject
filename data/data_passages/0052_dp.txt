English Ivy betrays its poor reputation as a nuisance by its unparalleled ability to provide shade.
By seamlessly covering the exterior of a building, it works as a natural insulator, blocking the sun and
decreasing air conditioning costs. This means big savings for both building tenants and homeowners
alike. And it can happen quickly, too. Under the proper conditions, established English Ivy can grow to
cover an area of roughly 500 square feet per year. Given that most homes have a roof measuring roughly
2000 square feet, ivy-friendly homeowners can rest assured that their roofs will be completely covered in
about four years. When considering growth rates of newly planted ivy, just remember the old adage: First
year, it sleeps. Second year, it creeps. Third year, it leaps! For English Ivy, this is especially true.
Now, detractors may take this opportunity to remind readers about how invasive English Ivy can
be. For what ivy enthusiast hasn't been cautioned about its ability to burrow holes, fracture windows, and
even deteriorate brick? But be warned. Oftentimes, this suggestion is taken to the comical extreme.
Naysayers take a strange pleasure in spinning yarns about a particularly malevolent strand of ivyâ€”one
that slips in through the cracks on a hot summer night, silently strangling homeowners in their sleep.
Admittedly, this can be a funny story to tell. But are we to believe such a tale? The intelligent gardener will
quickly dismiss such rubbish for what it is.
