There is an old oak tree in my back yard. The tree is big. It has many branches. It has been growing there all my life.
The tree looks healthy. But today I noticed something new. One of its branches looks different. Something is wrong with it. It hangs lower than the others, and it doesn't have any leaves on it. It looks to me like the branch is dead.
Maybe the branch died because it was damaged. There was a big storm last night. Maybe something fell on it. Or it could have been struck by lightning. But maybe there is another reason. Maybe the tree has a disease. I think a disease could cause the tree branch to look the way it does.
Only an expert can tell if the tree has a disease. An expert will have to look closely at the tree. After this examination, I will know if it has a disease. If it has a disease, then that would be bad. That's because diseases can spread. If the disease spreads, then the whole tree will have a problem. The whole tree will start to die. If the whole tree is dying, then it will have to be cut down. It is too dangerous to have a big, dying tree near the house.
I really like that big old tree. It has been growing there all my life. I hope I won't have to cut it down.
