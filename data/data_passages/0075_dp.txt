At an earlier time in her life, Ursula Pugh was – before injuries,
before a disastrous marriage, before the death of her beloved
sister – a glorious dancer.
Now, she was regarded by many as an angry has-been and
a horrible teacher.
I was not cognizant of these details as I made my way through the doors of The
Ursula Children’s Theater with my three rambunctious boys in tow. And if I had
known such information, it would not have biased my decision in the least.
I was looking for a safe haven in the neighborhood – someplace free from the
drugs and gangs that made their way around the community after hours – for the
boys to spend time after school. Staying at home by themselves was not an
option. They definitely needed adult supervision if I expected my home to still be
standing when I got home from work. The children’s theater, much to my
boys’ chagrin, was more convenient for me to get to than the karate studio.
“No, Mama, we want karate,” the boys had implored pitifully. I’m glad I wasn’t
swayed though I would not realize until much later what a fortuitous decision
this was.
Ms. Pugh looked up over her glasses as we arrived at the studio. “Boys!” she
exclaimed before I could even introduce myself. “Wonderful.”
It turned out that Ms. Pugh’s program was woefully short of boys and mine were
immediately thrown into every production possible at the theater.
The rumors were right, in some respects. Ms. Pugh could be brusque and rude
with her charges and did not tolerate any signs that a student was not fully
dedicated to the program.
My boys flourished in this environment. My wild, rough boys, who were often so
rude that they embarrassed me in public, gradually became a different species.
They will certainly never be world-class dancers, but Ms. Pugh’s strict ways
taught them to be respectful and on time. Moreover, it taught them to follow
directions and always strive to do their best.
