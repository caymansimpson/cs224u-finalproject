My cell phone rings again. It is futile to ignore it anymore; Valerie is
persistent. When Valerie wants something, she will continue to bedevil me until
I acquiesce.
“Hello,” I answer.
“State Fair, Bobbie?” she asks in her singsong voice. “When are we heading out?
Only two more days left!”
I abhor the State Fair. The boisterous crowds, the insanely long lines and the
impossibility of finding a clean restroom all combine to make this an event that I
dread.
For Valerie, my best friend since the angst of middle school, the State Fair is a
sign that divine powers really do exist.
“Really, Bobbie, where else can you pet a cow, ride a horse, fall ten stories, see
the world’s smallest person and eat fried macaroni and cheese?” Valerie asks
gleefully.
“Hell?” I guess.
The fried food at the State Fair is a gastronomical nightmare on its own. I once
tried a fried pickle at the fair and was sick to my stomach for hours. And a fried
donut hamburger with bacon, cheese AND a greasy egg? How could that not
be deleterious?
I have not seen Valerie for a good month; our schedules are both so hectic. My
hatred of the State Fair becomes inconsequential compared to my desire
to hang with Val.
Alas, I ignore my anti-fair bias for the umpteenth year.
“Pick me up at noon,” I say and hang up the phone.
