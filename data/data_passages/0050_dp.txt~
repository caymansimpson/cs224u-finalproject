Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects millions of people
around the world. Individuals can develop PTSD after experiencing any event that results in psychological
trauma. Symptoms of PTSD involve flashbacks to the traumatic event, nightmares, obsessive behavior,
anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and hypervigilance. Individuals who suffer from PTSD can
experience significant difficulties in social relationships, have lower self-esteem, and have trouble
maintaining employment. People with PTSD experience a higher risk of committing suicide, developing a
drug addiction, and suffering from alcoholism. Although PTSD can affect any individual, military veterans
are especially susceptible to this debilitating affliction. Furthermore, within this population, women are
more than twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. Studies have also shown that former service women
who do develop PTSD experience more severe symptoms than their male counterparts. Recent changes
made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female
veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done.
Although studies investigating precisely why women are more likely than men to experience
PTSD have not yet been completed, some experts have theorized that low unit cohesion is a major factor.
Unit cohesion, defined as the mutual bonds of friendship and support among members of a military unit,
is thought to be helpful in reducing the incidence of developing PTSD. According to recent surveys
compiled by U.S. Army researchers, increased unit cohesion emerged as the most important factor
determining whether soldiers developed suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely than men to
experience low unit cohesion for a variety of reasons. One of the most obvious factors is the relative
paucity of females in the military; currently, women make up only 20% of the armed forces. Pervasive
male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers.
Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women
are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD,
depression, or other serious mental health problems.
Another issue at play is the stigma amongst military personnel that asking for help for mental
health issues makes one “weak.” A recent Department of Defense study of returning combat troops
shows that only 1 in 6 veterans acknowledged themselves to be suffering from symptoms of PTSD, and 3
out of 5 veterans were convinced that their comrades and commanding officers would lose confidence in
them if they sought treatment for mental health issues. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a
sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as
equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude
than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this
stereotype. Unfortunately for those who do not seek help, when PTSD goes untreated it is very likely to
worsen over time.
Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for
women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered
direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are
placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent
regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be
eligible for benefits.
Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD
sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays disability
benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these
individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors
is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or
treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to
