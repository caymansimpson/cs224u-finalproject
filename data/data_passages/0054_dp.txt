Most would agree that the most important city in America—culturally speaking, at least—is New York City. Yet, at nearly any point in American history prior to about a century ago, everyone would have agreed the most important city in America was Boston. How did New York usurp this distinction from Boston?
A new book by a historian and English professor proposes a theory: New York overtook Boston because of the advent of mass media. Before mass media, there were still divides between high culture and low culture. Crowds would flock to vaudeville shows which traveled from town to town, allowing them to exist without a set location. This meant that there was no cultural center for popular culture, but Boston, with its clergymen, its poets, its Transcendentalists, its political theorists, and its great writers was the center for high culture. When radio and movies came around though, they naturally found a home base in New York, the nation’s largest city. This caused a mass cultural shift, as huge stars were created: Mary Pickford, Babe Ruth, and Irving Berlin. These stars all lived in New York, and so too did a new breed of intellectuals and writers (such as W.E.B. DuBois and F. Scott Fitzgerald) who also sought both mass communications such as radio and the tabloid party circuit.
Thus, the author concludes (perhaps a bit too simplistically, despite her obvious breadth of knowledge), New York is the most important city in the United States not because of its size or influence but simply because it was the largest city in America (and still is) at the advent of mass media.
