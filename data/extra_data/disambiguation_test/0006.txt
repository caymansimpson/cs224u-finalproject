The city of Havana stands today as a testament to its turbulent yet glorious history.
This lively center of all things Cuban looks today as much as it did when it was built more than 100 years ago.
An air of distinction and wealth, albeit now somewhat faded, lingers in its neighborhoods.
Spanish architecture, a symbol of a colonial past, graces the city, though the paint and plaster of many of the buildings have chipped and peeled as the years have passed.
Amidst the gentle aging of this great city, it is the generosity and friendliness of the residents that have allowed Havana to survive and flourish.
