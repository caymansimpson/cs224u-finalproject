On receiving the Congressional Medal for Distinguished Civilian Achievement, Dr.
Jonas Salk declared, “I feel that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more.”
People worldwide would agree that, in his forty-year medical career, Salk did a stunning amount for humanity.
His work developing the first polio vaccine was the opening shot in a war that has led to the disease’s virtual eradication.
(In 2001, polio, which once paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children annually, claimed only 600 new victims worldwide.)
Though Salk’s vaccine has been superseded by Albert Sabin’s cheaper oral vaccine, Salk’s legacy and name live on.
