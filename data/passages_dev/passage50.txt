I have found the effect of comic books to be first of all anti-educational.
They interfere with education in the larger sense.
For children, education is not merely a question of learning, but is a part of mental health.
They do not "learn " online in school; they learn also during play, from entertainment, and in social life with adults and with other children.
To take large chunks of time out of a child's life -- time during which he or she is not positively, that is, educationally, occupied -- means to interfere with healthful mental growth.
To make a sharp distinction between entertainment and learning is poor pedagogy, and even worse psychology.
A great deal of learning comes in the form of entertainment, and a great deal of entertainment painlessly teaches important things.
By no stretch of critical standards can the text in comics qualify as literature, or the drawings as art.
Children spend an enormous amount of time on comic books, but their gain is nil.
They do not learn how to read a serious book or magazine.
They do not gain a true picture of the West from the "Westerns".
They do not learn about any normal aspects of sex, love, or life.
I have known many adults who have treasured throughout their lives some of the books they read as children.
I have never came across any adult or adolescent who had outgrown comic book reading who would ever dream of keeping any of these "books" for any sentimental or other reason.
In other words, children spend a large amount of their time and money on these publications and have nothing positive to show for it.
And since almost all good children's reading has some educational value, comics by their very nature are not only non-educational; they are anti-educational.
They fail to teach anything that might be useful to a child; they do suggest many things that are harmful.
