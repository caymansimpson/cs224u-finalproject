There was an empty room at the top of our house and on the wall, between the fireplace and the window, almost hidden in the gloom, hung a small portrait in oils.
Dim and yellowed by time, that picture showed the head of a man of strange appearance, for he had long hair and below his pointed bear was some kind of wide collar brim.
His face was melancholy and yet it always seemed to me that there was a sneer upon those bearded lips.
Children rarely look up when they are playing with toys on the floor, for they are too busy with their own imaginings, but one day, when I had strayed into that vacant room and was amusing myself, I happened to glance toward the portrait and saw, to my astonishment, that the eyes of the man were watching me.
I turned away, then looked up, and once more his eyes met mine.
I got to my feet and, as I did so, those eyes turned to watch every movement I made.
I backed toward the door and that look still followed me, half-mournful, half-accusing.
I did not tell anyone what had happened, but I did not venture into the room again for more than a few seconds at a time, except when I was with grown-ups.
Emboldened by their company, I learned to play a fearful but exciting game.
I moved slowly here and there about the room, pretending not to look, I talked with my elders, then swung around sharply.
I was still being watched.s
The searching gaze was always the same, so melancholy and accusing that I began to feel a sense of guilt, began to wonder what evil I could have committed.
Guilt and fear mingled in my mind and I was certain that the stranger was treacherous, that his anger could be terrible when it was aroused.
Sometimes greatly daring, I crept up the stairs and opened the door very quietly, very quickly, and peeped in.
Every time I did so, his eyes were looking straight at me.
