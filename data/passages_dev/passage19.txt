Cloning creates serious issues of identity and individuality.
The cloned person may experience concerns about his or her distinctive identity, not only because the person will be in genotype (genetic makeup) and appearance identical to another human being, but, in this case, because he or she may also be twin to the person who is the “father” or “mother”—if one can still call them that.
What would be the psychic burdens of being the “child” or “parent” of your twin?
The cloned individual, moreover, will be saddled with a genotype that has already lived.
He or she will not be fully a surprise to the world.
People will likely always compare a clone’s performance in life with that of the original.
True, a cloned person’s nurture and circumstances in life will be different; genotype is not exactly destiny.
Still, one must also expect parental and other efforts to shape this new life after the original—or at least to view the child with the original vision always firmly in mind.
Why else then would they clone from the star basketball player, mathematician, and beauty queen—or even dear old dad—in the first place?
Since the birth of Dolly, there has been a fair amount of doublespeak on this matter of genetic identity.
Experts have rushed in to reassure the public that the clone would in no way be the same person, or have any confusions about his or her identity; they are pleased to point out that the clone of film star Julia Roberts would not be Julia Roberts.
Fair enough.
But one is shortchanging the truth by emphasizing the additional importance of the environment, rearing, and social setting: genotype obviously matters plenty.
That, after all, is the only reason to clone, whether human beings or sheep.
The odds that clones of basketball star Larry Bird will play basketball are, I submit, infinitely greater than they are for clones of jockey Willie Shoemaker.
