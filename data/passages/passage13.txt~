Words have always held a particular power for me.
I remember leafing through a book of Native American poems one morning while I was waiting for my Shakespeare class to begin and being struck by a phrase from the preface, “The word, the word above all, is truly magical, not only by its meaning, but by its artful manipulation.”
This quote, which I added to my journal, reminded me of something my grandfather had told me when I was a girl: “If you say a word often enough it becomes your own.”
I added that phrase to my journal next to the quote about the magic of words.
When I traveled home to Baltimore for my grandfather’s funeral a year after my journal entry, I mentioned my grandfather’s words to my
father.
He corrected me.
He told me that my grandfather had actually said, “If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.”
I was still a student at the time, but I knew even then, even before I had made a conscious decision to teach as well as act, that my grandfather’s words would be important.
Actors are very impressionable people, or some would say, suggestible people.
We are trained to develop aspects of our memories that are more emotional and sensory than intellectual.
The general public often wonders how actors remember their lines.
What’s more remarkable to me is how actors remember, recall, and reiterate feelings and sensations.
The body has a memory just as the mind does.
The heart has a memory, just as the mind does.
The act of speech is a physical act.
It is powerful enough that it can create, with the rest of the body, a kind of cooperative dance.
That dance is a sketch of something that is inside a person, and not fully revealed by the words alone.
I came to realize that if I were able to record part of the dance—that is, the spoken part—and reenact it, the rest of the body would follow.
I could then create the illusion of being another person by reenacting something she had said as she had said it.
My grandfather’s idea led me to consider that the reenactment, or the reiteration, of a person’s words would also teach me about that person.
I had been trained in the tradition of acting called “psychological realism.”
A basic tenet of psychological realism is that characters live inside of you and that you create a lifelike portrayal of the character through a process of realizing your own similarity to the character.
When I later became a teacher of acting, I began to become more and more troubled by the self-oriented method.
I began to look for ways to engage my students in putting themselves
in other people’s shoes.
This went against the grain of the psychological realism tradition, which was to get the character to walk in the actor’s shoes.
It became less and less interesting intellectually to bring the dramatic literature of the world into a classroom of people in their late teens and twenties, and to explore it within the framework of their real lives.
Aesthetically it seemed limited, because most of the time the characters all sounded the same.
Most characters spoke somewhere inside the rhythmic range of the
students.
More troubling was that this method left an important bridge out of acting.
The spirit of acting is the travel from the self to the other.
This “self-based” method seemed to come to a spiritual halt.
It saw the self as the ultimate home of the character.
To me, the search for character is constantly in motion.
It is a quest that moves back and forth between the self and the other.
I needed evidence that you could find a character’s psychological reality by “inhabiting” that character’s words.
I needed evidence of the limitations of basing a character on a series of metaphors from an actor’s real life.
I wanted to develop an alternative to the self-based technique, a technique that would begin with the other and come to the self, a technique that would empower the other to find the actor rather than the other way around.
