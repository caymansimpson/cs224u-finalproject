In 1846, when the three Bronte sisters, hoping for publication, sent their verses to Messrs.
Aylott and Jones, they adopted masculine pseudonyms, calling themselves Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.
Strictly speaking, this masculine disguise was unnecessary: in England, women writers had been published since the 1670s, when the novelist and playwright Aphra Behn became the first woman to earn a living with her pen.
The Brontes, however, knew the prejudice they would face, were they to publish under their own names.
Even Robert Southey, then Poet Laureate of England, shared this common prejudice, writing to Charlotte Bronte, “Literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life, and it ought not to be.”
