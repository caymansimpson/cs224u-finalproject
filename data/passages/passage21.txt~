“I never thought I would live in such a beautiful place,” Mrs. Deverell told Angel when they first moved in.
But nowadays she often suffered from the lowering pain of believing herself happy when she was not.
“Who could be miserable in such a place?” she asked.
Yet, on misty October evenings or on Sundays, when the church bells began, sensations she had never known before came over her.
She sometimes felt better when she went back to see her friends on Volunteer Street; but it was a long way to go.
Angel discouraged the visits, and her friends seemed to have changed.
Either they put out their best china and thought twice before they said anything, or they were defiantly informal—“You’ll have to take us as you find us”—and would persist in making remarks like “Pardon the apron, but there’s no servants here to polish the grate.”
In each case, they were watching her for signs of grandeur or condescension.
She fell into little traps they laid and then they were able to report to the neighbors.
“It hasn’t taken her long to start putting on airs.”
She had to be especially careful to recognize everyone she met, and walked up the street with an expression of anxiety which was misinterpreted as disdain.
The name “Deverell Family Grocer” stayed for a long time over the shop, and she was pleased that it should, although Angel frowned with annoyance when she heard of it.
Then one day the faded name was scraped and burnt away, and on her next visit to Volunteer Street, she saw that “Cubbage’s Stores” was painted there instead.
She felt an unaccountable panic and dismay at the sight of this and at the strange idea of other people and furniture in those familiar rooms.
“Very nice folk,” she was told.
“She’s so friendly.
Always the same.
And such lovely kiddies.”
Mrs. Deverell felt slighted and wounded; going home she was so preoccupied that she passed the wife of the landlord of The Volunteer without seeing her.
“I wouldn’t expect Alderhurst people to speak to a barkeep’s wife,” the woman told everyone in the saloon bar.
“Even though it was our Gran who laid her husband out when he died.”
All of their kindnesses were remembered and brooded over; any past kindness Mrs. Deverell had done—and they were many—only served to underline the change which had come over her.
At a time of her life when she needed the security of familiar things, these were put beyond her reach.
It seemed to her that she had wasted her years acquiring skills which in the end were to be of no use to her: her weather-eye for a good drying day; her careful ear for judging the gentle singing sound of meat roasting in the oven; her touch for the freshness of meat; and how, by smelling a cake, she could tell if it were baked.
These arts, which had taken so long to perfect, fell now into disuse.
She would never again, she grieved, gather up a great fragrant line of washing in her arms to carry indoors.
One day when they had first come to the new house, she had passed through the courtyard where sheets were hanging out: she had taken them in her hands and, finding them just at the right stage of drying, had begun to unpeg them.
They were looped all about her shoulders when Angel caught her.
“Please leave work to the people who should do it,” she had said.
“You will only give offense.”
She tried hard not to give offense; but it was difficult.
The smell of ironing being done or the sound of eggs being whisked set up a restlessness which she could scarcely control.
The relationship of mother and daughter seemed to have been reversed, and Angel, now in her early twenties, was the authoritative one; since girlhood she had been taking on one responsibility after another, until she had left her mother with nothing to perplex her but how to while away the hours when the servants were busy and her daughter was at work.
Fretfully, she would wander around the house, bored, but afraid to interrupt; she was like an intimidated child.
