In her introduction to the first Omnibus of Crime,
Dorothy Sayers wrote that the detective story “does not,
and by hypothesis never can, attain the loftiest level of
literary achievement.” And she suggested somewhere else
that this is because it is a “literature of escape” and not “a
literature of expression.” I do not know what the loftiest
level of literary achievement is; neither did Aeschylus or
Shakespeare; neither did Miss Sayers. Other things being
equal, which they never are, books with a more powerful
theme will provoke a more powerful performance. Yet
some very dull books have been written about God, and
some very fine ones about how to make a living and stay
fairly honest. It is always a matter of who writes the stuff,
and what the individual has to write it with. As for litera-
ture of expression and literature of escape, this is critics’
jargon, a use of abstract words as if they had absolute
meanings. Everything written with vitality expresses that
vitality; there are no dull subjects, only dull minds. All
people who read escape from something else into what lies
behind the printed page; the quality of the dream may be
argued, but its release has become a functional necessity.
All people must escape at times from the deadly rhythm of
their private thoughts. It is part of the process of life among
thinking beings. It is one of the things that distinguish them
from the three-toed sloth. I hold no particular brief for the
detective story as the ideal escape. I merely say that all
reading for pleasure is escape, whether it be Greek or The
Diary of the Forgotten Man. To say otherwise is to be an
intellectual snob, and a juvenile at the art of living.
I think that what was really gnawing at Dorothy Sayers’
mind was the realization that her kind of detective story
was an arid formula that could not even satisfy its own
implications. It was second-rate literature because it was
not about the things that could make first-rate literature.
If it started out to be about real people (and she could
write about them—her minor characters show that), they
must very soon do unreal things in order to conform to
the artificial pattern required by the plot. When they did
unreal things, they ceased to be real themselves. They
became puppets and cardboard lovers and papier-mâché
villains and detectives of exquisite and impossible gentility.
The only kind of writer who could be happy with these
properties was the one who did not know what reality was.
Dorothy Sayers’ own stories show that she was annoyed by
this triteness: the weakest element in them is the part that
makes them detective stories, the strongest the part that
could be removed without touching the “problem of logic
and deduction.” Yet she could not or would not give her
characters their heads and let them make their own mystery.
