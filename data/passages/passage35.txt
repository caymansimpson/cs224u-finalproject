Should a novelist be allowed to take liberties with the lives of historical figures?
This question has engaged critics for centuries, with some supporting the cause of historical accuracy and others weighing in on the side of artistic freedom.
There is, to my mind, a difference between Daniel Defoe’s use of the story of Alexander Selkirk, who endured four years as a castaway, to create his character Robinson Crusoe, and Doctorow’s wholesale appropriation of historical personages such as Booker T. Washington and Emma Goldman, whose fame or notoriety he capitalizes on as he makes them “interact” with his fictional characters.
