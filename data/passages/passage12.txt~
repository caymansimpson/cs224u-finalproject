The ability of the “I Have a Dream” speech to highlight King’s early career at the expense of his later career accounts for the tone of impatience and betrayal that often appears when modern-day supporters of King’s agenda talk about the speech.
Former Georgia state legislator Julian Bond said in 1986 that commemorations of King seemed to “focus almost entirely on Martin Luther King the dreamer, not on Martin King the antiwar activist, not on Martin King the challenger of the economic order, not on Martin King
the opponent of apartheid, not on the complete Martin Luther King.”
One King scholar has proposed a ten-year moratorium on reading or listening to the “I Have a Dream” speech, in the hopes that America will then discover the rest of King’s legacy.
This proposal effectively concedes that King’s magnificent address cannot be recovered from the misuse and overquotation it has suffered since his death.
But it is not clear that this is so.
Even now, upon hearing the speech, one is struck by the many forms of King’s genius.
Many people can still remember the first time they heard “I Have a Dream,” and they tend to speak of that memory with the reverence reserved for a religious experience.
At the very least, reflecting on the “I Have a Dream” speech should be an opportunity to be grateful for the astonishing transformation of America that the freedom movement wrought.
In just under a decade, the civil rights movement brought down a system of segregation that stood essentially unaltered since Reconstruction.
King’s dreams of an America free from racial discrimination are still some distance away, but it is astounding how far the nation has come since that hot August day in 1963.
Segregation in the South has been dismantled; there are no longer “Whites Only” signs; segregationist governors do not try to prevent Black children from entering public schools.
Toward the end of his life, King preached a sermon entitled “Ingratitude,” in which he called ingratitude “one of the greatest of all sins,” because the sinner “fail[s] to realize his dependence on others.”
The annual Martin Luther King holiday is properly a day of national thanksgiving, a time for the nation to recognize the immense debt it owes to King and the thousands of heroes of the civil rights movement for saving the soul of America.
