While my mother's parents spent their lives in New York, my paternal grandparents were born and raised in neighboring villages of Austria.
My grandfather's father owned a liquor store and was very religious.
My grandfather was the academic of the family.
He completed high school, college and graduate degrees.
He worked as a teacher and principal, much more respected positions then than now.
I connected deeply with this grandfather, Herman.
He and I are sensitive, loving, prone to worry, and innately talented teachers.
Though my grandparents and great-grandparents were born in Austria, I am not Austrian.
This, I believe, is the case for many Jews in the United States.
Belonging to this religion is a cultural heritage as well as a faith.
Though I rarely think of myself as Jewish and pay small heed to the holidays, Judaism is a large part of my identity.
